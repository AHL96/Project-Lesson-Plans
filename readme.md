# Pygame Projects & Lesson plans

These games are examples of games to make.

# Prior knowledge for projects

- flow control (if, else, for, while)
- variables (numbers, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, pointers)
- arithmetic (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
- boolean logic (and, or, not, in)
- functions/methods (parameters, return statement)
- random module
- classes
- basic inheritance
- sprites
- XY coordinates
- collisions

# Space Shooter (~400 lines)

## **Things to Stress**

- the importance of organization (separate files, good variable names, comments)
- big project (~400 lines)
- how much a good text editor can help you (recommend atom, vscode might become overwhelming)

## **Things to Learn**

- sprites (inheritance)
- game loop
- event loop
- events
- pygame groups
- game timing
- basic terminal usage


# Platform Jumper (~525 lines)

## **Things to Learn**
- *Math equations* (basic laws of motion; velocity, acceleration, gravity, friction)
- file organization
- reading and writing to files
- sprite sheets
- XML files
- list unpacking
- a little searching
- pygame Group has()
- pygame groups again
- pygame LayeredUpdates(), *_layer*
- python conventions (underscore before a class variable is the convention for "private")
- pixel perfect collisions / Masks (more computing power)

# Title-Based Survival game
**only to be used to show what pygame can make**

## **Things to Learn**
- parameter defaulting
- pygame.key.set_repeat(s,d)
- enumerate()
- using text file to design game map
- smooth motion
- Camera class
- .strip()
- Rect.move()
- trigonometry
- vectors
- isinstance()
- making maps in Tiled
- pytmx module
